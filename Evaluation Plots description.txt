Evaluation plots show the evaluation metric values of ENMeval models; dela-AICc, Average test AUC
and average difference between training and testing AUC.The first two are metrics of model quality 
while the third is a metric of model overfitting. Low delta-AICc and high average test-AUC indicate
high quality models, while high average difference between training and test AUC indicates an 
overfitted model. 

Models with only linear response functions in general performed worse than those with linear and 
quadratic or linear, quadratic and product response functions, but were less prone to overfitting than 
models with linear, quadratic and hinge features. The best models based on delta AICc values were 
those with linear and quadratic or linear quadratic and hinge response functions and regularization 
multipliers between 0.05 and 5.

However, based on the average test AUC metric, models with linear, quadratic and hinge feature 
classes outperform those with only linear and quadratic feature classes for most values of the 
regularization multiplier on all model runs. While optimal models identified by AICc and AUC metrics
are often similar, they rarely match exaxtly. While the average difference between training and test
AUC metric decreases with increasing values of the regularisation multiplier, it is low (below 0.1) 
for all models except the most complex (LHQ with a regularization multiplier under 0.5), so no 
candidate models are dramatically overfitted.


However, as there is little difference in output metrics between many of the model iterations, it 
must be noted that most model iterations produce qualitatively similar predictions in niche and 
geographic space, and that differences are largely a matter of scaling and sensitivity.
